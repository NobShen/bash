1. Login to MySQL as root (sudo will bypass password prompt)

$ sudo mysql -u root
2. Change to the mysql database and set the plugin to mysql_native_password for the root user.

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
3. You have to change the root password for this to work. Even just specifying the current password is fine too, but this command must be executed:

mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password_here';
mysql> exit;
4. Lastly, restart MySQL for the changes to take effect.

$ sudo systemctl restart mysql
5. You can now login to MySQL root as normal, and will no longer encounter the error.

$ mysql -u root -p
